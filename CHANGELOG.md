All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-13

Initial release.

- Middleware `BlockScannerRequests` — opt-in, detects known vulnerability-scanner paths (WordPress probes, .git/.env leaks, admin-tooling scans, framework probes) and repeat offenders get banned after a configurable threshold.
- Optional ASN-level hard block via `jeffersongoncalves/laravel-visitor-fingerprint`'s resolved GeoIP data.
- `scanner_guard_bans` table for permanent audit — stores only a salted IP hash, never a raw IP.
- `scanner-guard:export-denylist` command to generate an nginx `deny <ip>;` denylist file for edge-level blocking.
- Deliberately responds 404 (not 403) by default so a banned scanner can't distinguish "banned" from "route doesn't exist".
